After attending the Strata Phd Summit this past week I also thought about a potential article titled "What Should Econometricians Do?"
In this article I would image the counterfactual about what econometrics would look like had Buchanan's plea in 1964 been seriously heeded
(about doing catallactics instead of narrowly focusing on optimization).I will link Hayek, Buchanan, Nau and Bayesian data analysis. This
will include what econometricians should learn from neighboring scientific disciplines such as statistical signals processing, statistical
pattern prediction, and machine learning. 

I don't believe that structural econometrics that takes the neoclassical optimization paradigm very seriously would exist. Instead, believe
a different modeling strategy would be called for. More like the one taken in the financial industry and less like academic finance.

Fischer Black predicted that econometrics would not survive. He was right about that in practice, but not about that in academics. The
politics of subsized econometric research is like Reagan and enjoys a Teflon factor (criticisms don't stick).
