# Introduction

In this project, I examine the many observed stylized empirical facts of dairy market spot, futures, and options prices
and relate them to the various dairy market policies that have been put in place over the years to regulate dairy
product prices. I argue that although the intended consequences of the policies are to stabilize dairy market prices,
these policies have had the exact opposite effect and have resulted in highly volatile prices with many observable
nonliear dynamic features.
